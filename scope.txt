A set of n images 
Generate a grid with the images where --DONE
-every image is used exactly twice  --DONE
-every pair has a shared identifier in order to enable comparison  --DONE
-positions are random --DONE
Images are overlayed by a default back image  --DONE

Clicking an overlay image exposes another image underneath --DONE
Clicking another overlay image exposes another image underneath  --DONE 
If these two images are identical, remove them from the field  --DONE
Else flip the images back  --DONE
Matched pairs stay flipped  --DONE


Make matched pair transparent
If all pairs are matched show congratulations and offer a game reset option  --DONE

Count number of flips needed   --DONE
Count time needed   --DONE
Ask player for their name
