A set of n images 
Generate a grid with the images where 
-every image is used exactly twice 
-every pair has a shared identifier in order to enable comparison 
-positions are random
Images are overlayed by a default back image 

Clicking an overlay image exposes another image underneath 
Clicking another overlay image exposes another image underneath 
If these two images are identical, remove them from the field, increase the score 
Else flip the images back and keep the score 

Add an aspect of competitiveness 
-either a maximum number of attempts 
-or measure the needed time and submit it to the server

Complexity 
-images are randomly selected from the server, e.g. based on a keyword
