A set of n images 
Generate a grid with the images where --DONE
-every image is used exactly twice  --DONE
-every pair has a shared identifier in order to enable comparison  --DONE
-positions are random --DONE
Images are overlayed by a default back image  --DONE

Clicking an overlay image exposes another image underneath --DONE
Clicking another overlay image exposes another image underneath  --DONE 
If these two images are identical, remove them from the field, increase the score 
Else flip the images back and keep the score 
Matched pairs stay flipped and become transparent 
If all pairs are matched show congratulations and offer a game reset option

Add an aspect of competitiveness 
- count number of attempts
-or measure the needed time
- submit the counts to the server once the game is over

Complexity 
-images are randomly selected from the server, e.g. based on a keyword
